title: Validation of Survey Configs

The validation of a survey configuration happens on the frontend (whenever a modified version is saved) as well as the backend. The backend also makes sure that the config JSON itself is well formatted (regarding data-types).

**Validation** refers to our check whether a survey config is in a valid state. All checks that are part of the validation process can be found here.

## Overall Checks

1. Checking whether all field-configs _(see below)_ are valid
2. If `(config.authentication == 'email')` then there has to be exactly one email field in config

:::tip

_Regarding 2:_ If you want to ask for more than one email and still have an email-authentication, you can just text fields for the other emails which are not used to authorize a submission.

:::caution

In addition to those things the console UI may have some bugs if there are more than 999 questions or 999 options on a selection-/radio-field. There are no checks for these conditions yet since this is a toleratable edge case. The reason for this behavior can be found in `console/src/utilities/form-helpers/add-local-ids.ts`

## Survey Settings

1. `1 <= config.title.length <= 120`
2. `0 <= config.description.length <= 2000`
3. `config.survey_name` is unique (for this user)
4. Without payment info: `1 <= config.limit <= 100`
5. With payment info: `1 <= config.limit <= 10000`

## Survey Fields

For every field type:

1. `1 <= fieldConfig.title.length <= 120`
2. `0 <= fieldConfig.description.length <= 2000`

<br />

**`Email`** fields:

3. `fieldConfig.hint.length <= 120`
4. `fieldConfig.regex.length <= 250`

<br />

**`Option`** fields: _nothing_

<br />

**`Radio`** fields:

3. For every option: `1 <= optionConfig.title.length <= 120`
4. `fieldConfig.fields.length >= 2` (at least two options)

<br />

**`Selection`** fields:

3. For every option: `1 <= optionConfig.title.length <= 120`
4. `0 <= fieldConfig.minSelect <= fieldConfig.maxSelect`
5. `fieldConfig.minSelect <= fieldConfig.maxSelect <= fieldConfig.fields.length`
6. `fieldConfig.fields.length >= 2` (at least two options)

<br />

**`Text`** fields:

4. `0 <= fieldConfig.minChars <= fieldConfig.maxChars`
5. `fieldConfig.minChars <= fieldConfig.maxChars <= 2000`

<br />

:::tip

Regarding the "at least two options" rule.

`Radio` fields: Since the respondent has to select an option, a single option doesn't make any sense.

`Selection` fields: A single checkbox (one selection option) can be achieved with an option field.
