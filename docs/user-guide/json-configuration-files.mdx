We designed our system in such a way that everything related to a survey both in the front- and the backend is generated from a single configuration in JSON format, which we simply call survey configuration.

Here you can see a very simple survey that asks your survey participants to describe why they like ice cream, should be simple right?

```json
{
    "survey_name": "option",
    "title": "Option Test",
    "description": "",
    "start": 1000000000,
    "end": 2000000000,
    "draft": false,
    "authentication": "open",
    "limit": 0,
    "fields": [
        {
            "type": "option",
            "title": "I have read and agree to the terms and conditions",
            "description": "",
            "required": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Each survey configuration has the same top level properties:

- `survey_name`: the name of the survey
- `title`: the (more detailed and readable) title of the survey
- `description`: here you can put a short description or introduction of the survey
- `start`: the time the survey is opened as unix timestamp (inclusive)
- `end`: the time the survey is closed as unix timestamp (exclusive)
- `draft`: if the survey is only a draft
- `authentication`: the submission authentication type of the survey
    - `open`: a free for all survey, everyone who has the link can submit (even multiple times)
    - `email`: a survey where the user submits her email address during the survey and we verify that the email is valid via a confirmation email (only the user's most recent submission counts)
    - `invitation`: a survey where you provide us with a list of email addresses, we send out personalized invitations, and ensure that only the persons that you specified can submit (only the user's most recent submission counts; submission **and** verification need to happen before the end date, so that results of the survey are fixed with the end date)
- `limit`: an optional submission count limit in order to keep costs in check; 0 for no limit
- `fields`: a list of the questions that the survey entails, see Field Types
