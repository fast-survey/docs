Since we do not want scale to an enterprise level, we will only look at the survey tools that seem
interesting for communities and small businesses.

## What is our goal?

Build an amazing survey tool with great pricing for small or rare use. I mean 300+€/year for just a couple of
surveys? No way! Best would be to have a pricing model based on real use -> actual pricing per survey submission.

There should be an easy way of creating and monitoring surveys: An admin panel for controlling all parts of the
survey. It would be amazing if this were to be the same endpoint for self hosted surveys as well!

In addition to that we want an easy way of self hosting the whole survey or individual parts of it
(backend/frontend/database/email).
