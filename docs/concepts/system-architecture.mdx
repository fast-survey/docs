## System Overview

We use the **Google Cloud Platform** for most of our infrastructure, **MongoDB Atlas**
for data storage, and **SendGrid** for sending emails.

You can use every FastSurvey feature by interacting with the backend directly. You will
find a full API reference on here soon. The frontend uses those same endpoints specified
in the API reference.

:::note
In our soon to be released self-hosting guide we will provide you with instructions to
use your own infrastructure instead of ours. However we will not be able to provide support
to self-hosting users and all feature releases will require your own setting up.

## Survey Identifier

Each survey can uniquely be identified with with the survey-identifier which is made up
of the username of the owner account and the survey-name: `survey-identifier` =
`username/survey-name`

You can name the survey how you like but we will generate a url-conform identifier.

## Survey Storage

We store each survey in as a `json` file in the MongoDB. There no way to fetch all
surveys from outside of our system. You can only fetch the `json`-specification of
one particular survey at once:

```https
GET https://backend.fastsurvey.io/<username>/<survey-name>/config
```

The same `json` config is used by both backend and frontend. The frontend will
access the config file via this route.

:::note
You can find the full guide on how to these config files are specified in the
section [Configuring with `json`]()

## Submission Storage

In our database there are two type of collections: `pending-records` and
`verified-records`.

When a participant submits his form, this data (including the email address) along
with a random `verification-token` will be saved as a `pending-submission`.

```https
POST https://backend.fastsurvey.io/<username>/<survey-name>/submit
```

Our system immediately sends out an email which contains the form data (form
validation purposes) as well as a link to verify that submission:

```https
GET https://backend.fastsurvey.io/<username>/<survey-name>/verify/<verification-token>
```

Once the user pressed that link the backend will copy the respective submission
from `pending-records` over to `verified-records` and removes all old
`verified-submission` with that user for that survey in the process.

Once that has been done the backend redirects the user to a frontend-page with
either a "success"-message or a "submission time has ended"-message.

:::note
Old `pending-submissions` will still be stored until a certain time after the
survey has ended so that when a participant submits a form multiple times and
clicks multiple distinct verification-links, the data verified at last will be
stored permanently.

We use a delay to deleted those records in case the owner re-opens the survey.
