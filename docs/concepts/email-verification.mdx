export function Flexbox (props) {
    return (
        <div style={{width: "100%", display: "flex", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center"}}>

In some surveys you might have to **enter an email to verify your submission**. In those cases
you can only submit the form when the email you specified is valid with regards to the survey.

## Submission

<Flexbox>
    <img src="/img/docs/concepts/survey-submission-01.png" style={{width: "min(100%, 450px)", borderRadius:"6px"}}/>
</Flexbox>

<br/>

:::note
Survey creators can specify an email format that has to be met for any submission of a particular
survey.

*As long as the specified email address is not valid, the submit button is grayed out and
you get a hint on what type of emails will be accepted with this survey.*
:::

## Verification

Once you successfully submitted your data you get redirected to the verification page.

<Flexbox>
    <img src="/img/docs/concepts/survey-submission-02.png" style={{width: "min(100%, 450px)", borderRadius:"6px"}}/>
</Flexbox>

<br/>

You will probably see a link that leads you directly to the respective email-inbox, *here: mail.tum.de*.

## Validation

You will receive a mail in which you can validate all form data once again.

<Flexbox>
    <img src="/img/docs/concepts/survey-submission-03.png" style={{width: "min(100%, 450px)", borderRadius:"6px"}}/>
</Flexbox>

<br/>

You will find two links: One for changing the submission data and one for confirming it.

*When using that "change"-link or the "back to the form"-link (from the verification page)
you will get redirected to the form with the previous data already filled out.*

:::note
We will support multiple languages soon!

We **do not use Cookies** or any other type of client side storage in the whole submission process!
:::

## Timing

Both form submissions and verification of the email are only possible during  the time specified
by the survey owner.

Every submission belonging to a particular email address will only be stored once. If you fill out
the form again and verify the second verification-email then that new submission will replace the old
one. In case the submission the is over, that old version will be your final counting submission.
