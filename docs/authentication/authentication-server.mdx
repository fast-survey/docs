You can get the full API reference - when running the server - from:

GET "/docs"
```

The `public_key` will be published via the index route:

```bash
GET "/"
```

```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "mode": "production",
    "public_key": "ssh-rsa ..."
}
```

## Login

:::note

All of these routes will respond with a status code `200` in case the
credentials provided are valid. Otherwise the status code is `401`
(unauthorized).

Login with **`email` and `password`**:

```bash
POST "/login/form"
# email and password as form-data
```

```json
{
    "oauth2_token": {
        "access_token": ...,
        "refresh_token": ...,
        "token_type": "bearer"
    },
    "account": ...
}
```

---

Login with **`access_token`**:

```bash
POST "/login/access"
# access_token as form-data
```

```json
{
    "account": ...
}
```

_No new `oauth2_token` necessary since the `access_token` is still valid._

---

Login with **`refresh_token`**:

```bash
POST "/login/refresh"
# refresh_token as form-data
```

```json
{
    "oauth2_token": {
        "access_token": ...,
        "refresh_token": ...,
        "token_type": "bearer"
    },
    "account": ...
}
```
