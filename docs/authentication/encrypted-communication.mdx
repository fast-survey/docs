It is important to make sure all communication happens over `https` and not
`http`. All `https` traffic will be encrypted by the SSL or TLS mechanisms during
transport. Two types of communication:

-   `form-data` for **Authentication Communication** (e.g. creating an account,
    logging in, etc.)

-   The 'Authorization' `header` for **Authenticated API Communication** (i.e.
    requests that enforce access reqstriction on the requested resource)

```bash
# form-data
curl 'http://localhost:3000/login' -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d '{"email": "...", "password": "..."}'

# header
curl 'http://localhost:3000/private-route' \
    -H 'Authorization: bearer <access_token>'
```

> Why do we only use `form-data` and `headers`?

Both **`form-data` and `headers` are encrypted by SSL/TLS**.

:::caution

`query parameters` or `path parameters` are not are encrypted by
SSL/TLS and therefore not supported.

```bash
# query parameters
curl 'http://localhost:3000/private-route?access_token=<access_token>'

# path parameters
curl 'http://localhost:3000/private-route/<access_token>'
```
