## Types of Authentication

### `API Keys`

Using **`API keys`** used to be a very common way of
authentication a client with an API. Once you log in
with valid credentials (e.g. email/username and
password) an random sequence of characters will be
generated. This is the `API key`.

-   The `API key` has to be stored in a database and is
    associated with that specific client via the database entry
-   It will be passed to the client that requests authentication

_Usage: The client just to passes this `API key` along with every API request._

Disadvantages:

-   There has to be an extra database/collection for these `API keys`
-   On every single request there has to be some database communication only
    for validating the `API key`
-   Generating a new `API key` generally requires the account credentials
    (e.g. email/username and password)

<br />

### `OAuth2 Tokens`

However this authentication provider uses another mechanism called **`OAuth2`**.

:::note

There are many reasons why this authentication mechanism is a good choice.
We will only cover a few advantages over using `API keys` but you can read the
full specification here: https://oauth.net/2/

## Encrypted Communication

It is important to make sure all communication happens over `https` and not
`http`. All `https` traffic will be encrypted by the SSL or TLS mechanisms during
transport. Two types of communication:

-   `form-data` for **Authentication Communication** (e.g. creating an account,
    logging in, etc.)

-   The 'Authorization' `header` for **Authenticated API Communication** (i.e.
    requests that enforce access reqstriction on the requested resource)

```bash
# form-data
curl 'http://localhost:3000/login' -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d '{"email": "...", "password": "..."}'

# header
curl 'http://localhost:3000/private-route' \
    -H 'Authorization: bearer <access_token>'
```

Both **`form-data` and `headers` are encrypted by SSL/TLS**.

<br />

:::caution

`query parameters` or `path parameters` are not are encrypted by
SSL/TLS and therefore not supported.

```bash
# query parameters
curl 'http://localhost:3000/private-route?access_token=<access_token>'

# path parameters
curl 'http://localhost:3000/private-route/<access_token>'
```
