*Soon: **Self-hosting guide with instructions** on how to use your own infrastructure
instead of ours in order to have the absolute control over everything going on.*

:::note
If you think about self-hosting FastSurvey because you are **not sure about the confidentiality
of the Google Cloud Platform**, you can have a look at the full SLA (Service Level
Agreement) between us and the Google Cloud here (soon).

## Some Important Information

:::tip
We explicitly encourage everyone to have a look at our code, to play with it, and to modify it. We love using open source software, and strongly believe that it's also the right way for FastSurvey. That's why we made it open source. For more specifics, please have a look at our license.
:::

<div>In our GitHub repositories you will find:</div>

* The whole frontend code
* The whole backend code

In the following documentation, we will provide you with all the information needed to get your own FastSurvey instance up and running on your own infrastructure.

:::caution
We are always open to discussions about new features or changes to FastSurvey. However, we will not be able to provide individual support and updates to self-hosting users that made a lot of modifications to our code. We hope you understand.
:::

:::warning
Unfortunately **we cannot provide you** with the code of the visual tool used to create and manage your surveys (admin dashboard). The reason for this is, that this tool would need lots of modifications to work smoothly on your system e.g. removing payment processes.

The good news is: The admin dashboard is basically just a tool to create JSON configuration files. You can easily create those yourself and manually load them in your database. Don't worry, we'll show you how!
