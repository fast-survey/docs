*Soon: **Self-hosting guide with instructions** on how to use your own infrastructure
instead of ours in order to have the absolute control over everything going on.*

:::note
If you want to self-host FastSurvey because you are **not sure about the confidentiality
of the Google Cloud Platform**, you can have a look at the full SLA (Service Level
Agreement) between us and the Google Cloud here (soon).

## Some Important Information

:::tip
With **our licence** you are allowed to fully modify all of the code if you make
it publicly available and do not sell our version our your modified version
to anyone standalone or as part of a product/service.

<div>We will provide you with:</div>

* The whole frontend code - with instructions on how to run it
* The whole backend code - with instructions on how to run it
* A guide on how to set up a MongoDB locally
:::

:::caution
We will **not be able to provide support** to self-hosting users.

All **new feature releases** will require your own setting up. There will be no quick
`upgrade`-script provided by us.
:::

:::warning
Unfortunately **we cannot provide you with the code of the admin-dashboard**. The reason
for that is: The quality of the product represents our personal work. When the product
is not working we will do our best to resolve these issues. With self-hosted possibly
modified code we cannot do that.

The admin dashboard requires quite some modification to be run on local infrastructure
and we do not want to be responsible for the pain (for survey-owners) of a
malfunctioning admin-dashboard.
