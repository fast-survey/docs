With the Email field you can obtain the email address of the user. We will verify the submitted address via a confirmation email. You have the possibility to specify a regex to constrain valid email addresses, e.g. `.*@protonmail.com` to accept only ProtonMail addresses.

## Properties

- `regex`: the regex by which valid email addresses are constrained
- `hint`: a textual hint e.g. how a valid email address could look like
