## Who are we?

We are two students from [TUM university][1] who are excited about amazing tools that sprinkle some joy into our day
when using them. That is why we've started building tools like that.



### Felix BÃ¶hm

*<strong>Responsible for: Backend and API Development</strong>*

Finished his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in early 2020 and is currently in his masters degree in CS at TUM.
He turned the inefficient clutter which has served as our 0.1 and 0.2 backend into a minimalist asynchronous beauty
that automatically generates its own API reference using OpenAPI 3.0.


### Moritz Makowski

*<strong>Responsible for: Frontend, System Design and Infrastructure</strong>*

About to finish his Bachelor's degree in <strong>Engineering Science</strong> in 2021 and going for a masters degree in
CS afterwards. Building websites since the days of server-side-MVC. Developed versions 0.1 and 0.2 as a playground and
a boilerplate for this tool. Managing all the cloud infrastructure.

*Check out our next project soon ;)*

## Development Infrastructure

### Heroku Setup

Version 0.1 used to be hosted on [<strong>Heroku</strong>][2]. Great service and perfect for this first version!

However, we wanted to have ...
* slightly more control over the servers (deployment, scaling, etc.)
* more advanced monitoring features (analytics, logging, tracing, etc.)

Of course you can make all of that work on Heroku as well but we worked with the Google Cloud Platform before and
liked it a lot. So therefore from version 0.2 onwards we switched to the setup described below.

### Google Cloud Setup

Backend and Frontend servers over [<strong>Google App Engine</strong>][3]. An amazing development experience when
using the Google Cloud Platform. One minor pain point is, that there is slightly too much documentation for some
things.

A [<strong>MongoDB</strong>][4] database fully managed via [<strong>Atlas</strong>][5] (hosted on GCP). Extremely
useful cluster-dashboard, superb documentation and great SDK's (in python at least).

Email sending via [<strong>SendGrid</strong>][6]. I cannot believe that I have not discovered this tool earlier! Some
minor conflicts with GMX accounts but awesome analytics and an exceptional development experience.

That is why we still use this infrastructure and why we started building tools as well ;)
