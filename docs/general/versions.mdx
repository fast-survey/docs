## Version 0.1

This version has only been used for the very first survey built by us. It did not include support for multiple surveys
and <Bad>was only designed to run with the survey it was made for</Bad>.

This was just a basic proof of concept that a custom survey tool could result in a superior experience.

You can find all the code from this version on [<strong>GitHub</strong>][1].



## Version 0.2

The basic layout of version 0.2 (routing, API-Design, etc.) was designed to handle multiple different surveys with all
the features of the previous version.

However: <Bad>Creating new surveys was based on copying parts of the code</Bad> of an existing survey and modifying
that code. Very flexible but definitely not feasible for a survey tool with the purpose of adding new surveys fast
and easily.

In addition to that, the server side code (<Tag>Python 3</Tag>) was still using <Tag>flask</Tag> and <Tag>pymongo</Tag>
which are <Bad>not asynchronous and therefore blocking during database requests and other time consuming operations</Bad>.

That's why this setup was not suited for an efficient survey tool!

You can find all the code from this version on <strong>GitHub</strong>:
[<strong>Frontend</strong>][2]/[<strong>Backend</strong>][3].



## Version 1.0

From this version on <Good>new surveys can be defined by using a <Tag>json</Tag> config file</Good>. No more
copy-pasting survey-code!

We already defined these config files for the past surveys as examples. Of course we provide rich documentation on how
to write these config files as well as a full API reference.

We use <Tag>FastAPI</Tag> as our <Good>asynchronous backend framework</Good>. In combination with <Tag>motor</Tag> (an
asynchronous wrapper for <Tag>pymongo</Tag>) the server side code is way more efficient than our last setup.

What performance increase are we talking about? We'll probably write a blog post about our findings soon :)
