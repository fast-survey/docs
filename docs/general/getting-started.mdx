FastSurvey is the survey tool we all deserve.

Our core values are:

- Modern: Sleek, minimalist interfaces, so that you can be on your way quickly
- Fast: Our surveys run on an asynchronous backend that's built to scale
- Intuitive: Not only for the user, but also for the survey creator
- Secure: Our code is open-source and backed by the community
  
We are **still in early development** - that is why the tool cannot be used by everyone yet!
