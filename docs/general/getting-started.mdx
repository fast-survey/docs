FastSurvey is a modern, fast and secure tool to conduct your surveys.

<div>Our core values are:</div>

- **Modern**: Sleek, minimalist interfaces, so that you can be on your way quickly
- **Fast**: Our surveys run on an asynchronous backend that's built to scale
- **Intuitive**: Not only for the user, but also for the survey creator
- **Secure**: Our code is open sourced and backed by the community

## Getting Started

We are **still in early development** - that is why the tool cannot be used by everyone yet!
