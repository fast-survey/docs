We are two students from [TUM university][1] who are excited about amazing tools that sprinkle some joy into our day
when using them. That is why we've started building tools like that.



### Felix BÃ¶hm

*<strong>Responsible for: Backend and API Development</strong>*

Finished his Bachelor's degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> in early 2020 and is currently in his masters
degree in CS at TUM. He turned the inefficient clutter which has served as our 0.1 and 0.2 backend into a minimalist
asynchronous beauty that automatically generates its own API reference using OpenAPI 3.0.


### Moritz Makowski

*<strong>Responsible for: Frontend, System Design and Infrastructure</strong>*

About to finish his Bachelor's degree in <strong>Engineering Science</strong> in 2021 and going for a masters degree in
CS afterwards. Building websites since the days of server-side-MVC. Developed versions 0.1 and 0.2 as a playground and
a boilerplate for this tool. Managing all the cloud infrastructure.
